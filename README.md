## üîç Key Analyses and Findings

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Removed records with zero sales, negative gross profit, or invalid profit margins to ensure data quality.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Identified outliers in freight costs and purchase prices, indicating potential inefficiencies.
- Detected products with zero sales, highlighting overstock or obsolete inventory.

### 3. Correlation Analysis

- Weak correlation between purchase price and gross profit suggests pricing strategies have limited impact on profitability.
- Strong correlation between purchase and sales quantities indicates efficient inventory turnover.

### 4. Vendor Segmentation

- Top 10 vendors account for 65.7% of total purchases, indicating a reliance that could pose supply chain risks.
- 198 brands exhibit high profit margins but low sales volumes, suggesting potential for targeted promotions or pricing adjustments.

### 5. Statistical Testing

- Conducted hypothesis testing to compare profit margins between top and low-performing vendors.
- Results confirm a significant difference, necessitating distinct strategies for each group.
